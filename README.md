# Birthday-Wish-using-Python
<h1>This is an python wrapper !!!</h1> 
Made by *Lakshmi deepak* Use this wrapper for birthday wishes to your friend in a different way using python.  
Firstly, what you have to do is? You have to install the required packages, don't worry about the code and blabla things.
I made it simple for you.

**_pip install -r requirements.txt_**   

and don't forget to connect the internet to your lap (this will take a while).....  
and then made changes in artfies located in arts folder, I have given a plain art for you and plainart with extra decorations too add the colors to your wish.    
and change the artfile in config.py, it is set to default change it to plainart or plainartwithstars, where you made the changes and added colors.  
Follow the color codes to add colors.    

you can change the speed of art in config.py by reducing the speed value, you increase the speed of art. Same for coding speed too, 0.001 is the defualt value  

at last run the     

**_python3 main.py_**
